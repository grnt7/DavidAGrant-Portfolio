# 🧑‍💻 David's Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — built using React and designed as a clean, modern interface to showcase my skills, projects, and learning journey as a front-end developer.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a mobile-first resume/portfolio app where I highlight my development skills, certifications, and personal projects. It’s also a learning playground where I practice mobile UI/UX concepts and experiment with responsive design.

Originally inspired by [Original Author](https://github.com/original-author) (if applicable), I’ve adapted and customized it to serve as my own interactive CV.

## 📱 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install


## 3. Install Dependancies

Next, you need to install all the dependancies using:

`npm install`

Once this is done, you can start the app with:

`npm start`

## 4. Fill in your personal info

To populate the website with all of your own data, open the public/resumeData.json file and simply replace the data in there with your own. Images for the porfolio section are to be put in the public/images/portfolio folder.

## 5. (OPTIONAL) Replacing images and/or fonts

If you want to display your own pictures then you have to replace the files at these locations: public/images/header-background.jpg, public/images/testimonials-bg.jpg and public/favicon.ico. FILE NAMES MUST NOT BE CHANGED else the code referencing these images will no longer work.

## 7. Finalising Resume

Once all the formatting and data input is finalised, run `npm run build`. This will create a dedicated build folder.

## 8. Host Resume Online

1. Open the build folder in the finder screen
2. Go to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and set up a profile
3. Go to the 'Sites Tab'
4. Simply Drag and drop the 'Build' Folder into the designated upload space
5. The app will begin deploying & the deployment URL will be presented!

🚀 BOOM, you are now LIVE!!!
