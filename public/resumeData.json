    "bio": "Hi there! I am David! My journey into coding began with the Meta Front-End Developer course, where I discovered a passion for building clean, user-friendly interfaces. Since then, I’ve been honing my skills in front-end development, with a strong focus on writing accessible, responsive, and efficient code. In addition to development, I’ve also studied the Google UX design Course and earned certifications in Google Digital Marketing and E-commerce plus Harvard's Python CS50. These experiences give me a broader perspective on creating products that not only work well—but truly connect with users. I'm excited to keep growing as a developer and contribute to meaningful, user-centered projects.",

This project involved creating a dynamic front-end with React and managing complex application state using Redux. User authentication was implemented using Google Auth and Firebase, where clicking on a link would direct users to a dedicated sign-in/sign-up page. Movie and TV show data were fetched from the TMDB API. The application also integrated Stripe Checkout for payment simulations, handling secure transactions and processing payment events via Webhooks, likely utilizing Firebase's serverless capabilities; the profile icon allows users to select a plan but it's a demo account on Stripe. The entire application was deployed and hosted on Netlify.",
