    "bio": "Hi there! I am David! My journey into coding began with the Meta Front-End Developer course, where I discovered a passion for building clean, user-friendly interfaces. Since then, I’ve been honing my skills in front-end development, with a strong focus on writing accessible, responsive, and efficient code. In addition to development, I’ve also studied the Google UX design Course and earned certifications in Google Digital Marketing and E-commerce plus Harvard's Python CS50. These experiences give me a broader perspective on creating products that not only work well—but truly connect with users. I'm excited to keep growing as a developer and contribute to meaningful, user-centered projects.",
